# FlashApp

FlashApp is an android application to help improve memory and learning thanks to the use of virtual flashcards

## How does it work?

### Collection creation

In the main screen there is the button to add the new collection.
*Attention: deck information cannot currently be changed.*

### Tag

The tag information is free text which at the moment its creation will not affect the operation of the application.

### Global

The part of the global collections is a non-editable part, they are decks that all users will see and can play.

### Collection

At the bottom right there is the button to add new cards, you can only upload images in the application.
Blank cards cannot be added.

### Play

Press "Jouer" and enjoy!

Look at the question, press "tourner" when you think you know the answer, if you guessed it press "vrai", otherwise "faux", when you run out of cards you will see your result.
